# Think
- Think how would you solve manually
- Think about hashmap - whether it can be used or not
- Think of sliding winow in array/string problems
- If it's square - path -> think about DFS/BFS
- Think if priority queue can be used or not

# Java Shortcuts

Arrays.stream(stones).sum();

Arrays.stream(dp).forEach(a -> Arrays.fill(a, -1));

Arrays.stream(list)
            .distinct()
            .count() <= 1;
            
System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(array));
